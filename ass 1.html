<p id="confusing"> I am Girwan Paudyal. I study in Deerwalk, which is pretty obvious because i got this assignment in Deerwalk. I studied in Galaxy Public School before Deerwalk.
    Charming school, really. Yeah, real nice school. See, I am a pretty sarcastic person. Seriously though, I miss my school and my friends. Moving on then, hobbies of
    this man include playing video games, playing video games and also, playing video games! Well, there's also guitar and flute, and my fondness for books; but these are 
    turning out to become quite rare, nowadays. Well, thats enough about me...I'm running out of time for this assignment anyways.(Its 10 51 pm on dec 1, you know)
